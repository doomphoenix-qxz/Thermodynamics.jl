Here I will be adopting a fairly well-agreed on nomenclature for chemical thermodynamics and transport properties

Thermodynamics                                                   Units are here. If nothing, it's dimensionless.
  ρ  is molar density                                            mol/m^3
  V  is specific volume; ie the inverse of ρ                     m^3/mol
  ρm and Vm are mass denisty and specific volume respectively    kg/m^3, m^3/kg
  Vt is total system volume should I need that                   m^3
  P  is pressure                                                 Pa
  (Note: pressure is often p in major thermo textbooks, but that looks similar to ρ, so I capitalized it)
  T  is temperature                                              K
  S  is specific entropy                                         J/kg*K
  U  is specific internal energy                                 J/mol
  H  is specific enthalpy                                        J/mol 
  A  is specific Helmholtz energy                                J/mol
  G  is specific Gibbs Energy                                    J/mol
  Cp is constant-pressure heat capacity                          J/mol*K
  Cv is constant-volume heat capacity                            J/mol*K
  R  is the ideal gas constant (= 8.31446 J/mol*K)               J/mol*K

Chemical Thermodynamics
  xᵢ is mole fraction 
  ωᵢ is mass fraction
  f  is fugacity                                                 Pa
  a  is activity
  ϕ  is fugacity coefficient (= fᵢ/Pᵢ)
  γ  is activity coefficient (= aᵢ/xᵢ)

Additional nomenclature from IAPWS and similar multiparameter equations of state
  φ  is dimensionless Helmholtz energy (= A/RT)
  δ  is dimensionless density (= ρ/ρc)
  τ  is inverse reduced temperature (= Tc/T)

Transport properties
  λ  is thermal conductivity.                                    W/m*K
  Note: k is sometimes used for this, but most scientific papers use λ
  μ  is dynamic viscosity                                        Pa*s
  ν  is kinematic viscosity (= μ/ρm) (This is Greek nu, not v)   m2/s
  α  is thermal diffusivity (= k/ρ*Cp)                           m2/s
  Pr is Prandtl number (= k*μ/Cp)         
  
Chemical Properties
  MW is molar mass/molecular weight                              kg/mol
  ρc, Pc, and Tc are critical density, pressure, and temperature respectively
